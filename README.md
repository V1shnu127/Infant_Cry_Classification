SER using cepstral features: MFCC, LFCC, GFCC

Dataset used: RAVDESS
DL Classifier used: CNN, BiLSTM

1) Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC): MFCC is used to replicate human auditory perception by applying the Mel scale, which is non-linearly spacedâ€”denser at lower frequencies and more spread out at higher frequencies. <br>
It extracts vocal tract characteristics by applying a logarithmic filterbank, emphasizing speech phonetics over pitch information.
<br>
2) Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC): LFCC utilizes linearly spaced filters instead of the Mel scale, ensuring equal emphasis on both low and high-frequency components. <br>
It captures detailed spectral information based on raw signal characteristics rather than human auditory perception making it especially beneficial for detecting abnormalities. <br>
Additionally, LFCC is less affected by nonlinear distortions in speech, allowing it to effectively analyze subtle spectral variations, which is crucial for medical and diagnostic applications.
<br>
3) Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC): GFCC employs gammatone filterbanks that mimic the human cochlear response, allowing it to capture both formant and pitch information. <br>
It is particularly robust to noise, making it highly effective for speech enhancement, speaker recognition etc. <br>
GFCC excels at identifying fine-grained spectral details, especially in noisy environments, making it a valuable feature extraction method for challenging acoustic conditions.
